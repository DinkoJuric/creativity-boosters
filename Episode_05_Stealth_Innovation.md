## 📋 QUICK RECAP (For Host Preparation)

> **One-line summary:** The most radical innovations often happen OUTSIDE official channels — through informal networks, "bootleg" projects, and deliberate bypassing of organizational approval.

**Core Story:** Jordan Cohen at Pfizer spent over a year secretly building "PfizerWorks" without top management approval. It eventually saved 66,000+ employee hours. The stealth approach was necessary BECAUSE the idea would have been killed if proposed officially.

**Red Thread / Narrative Arc:**
1. PARADOX: Activity is "illegitimate" but intended to benefit the organization
2. RESEARCH: Harvard/Imperial College studies on why radical ideas need to "violate" processes
3. CASE STUDY: PfizerWorks — stealth innovation in a Fortune 500
4. FRAMEWORK: Lockheed's Skunk Works principles — Kelly Johnson's 14 Rules
5. ACTION: How managers can create "safe to fail" zones

**Positioning:** Permission-giving episode. Legitimizes the "shadow work" many employees are already doing.

## 🎙️ INTRO + THESIS

*[2 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Welcome back to Creativity Boosters.

I'm Dinko...

**NIKHIL:**

...and I'm Nikhil.

**DINKO:**

Today's episode might make some executives uncomfortable.

Because we're talking about a form of innovation that...

Technically...

Isn't supposed to happen.

**NIKHIL:**

It's called **stealth innovation.**

Also known as bootlegging.

Or underground R&D.

Or — my favorite — 

"Playing offense without asking the coach."

**DINKO:**

Here's the definition:

> Employees engage in self-directed innovation activity...
> 
> That isn't recognized or supported by the organization.

**NIKHIL:**

And here's the paradox:

The activity is **illegitimate**...

But intended to **benefit** the organization.

**DINKO:**

Research from Imperial College London by Dr. Paola Criscuolo found...

That this happens more often than leaders realize.

And sometimes...

It's the **only** way radical ideas survive.

## 📖 SEGMENT 1: THE RESEARCH

*[7 minutes]*

**NIKHIL:**

Let's start with what the academic research actually says.

Because this isn't just anecdotes.

There's serious study behind this.

**DINKO:**

Harvard Business Review published a piece called...

"The Case for Stealth Innovation."

By Paddy Miller and Thomas Wedell-Wedellsborg.

**NIKHIL:**

Their core argument:

> When you anticipate fierce internal resistance to an idea...
> 
> Sometimes you need to implement it "under the radar."

*[Source: HBR — "The Case for Stealth Innovation" — [hbr.org](https://hbr.org/)]*

**DINKO:**

Why would an idea face internal resistance?

**NIKHIL:**

Several reasons.

**It threatens existing power structures.**

If your idea makes a department less relevant...

That department will fight it.

**DINKO:**

**It challenges institutional assumptions.**

"We've always done it this way."

New approaches trigger defensive reactions.

**NIKHIL:**

**It's too radical to explain without a prototype.**

Some ideas sound crazy until you can show them working.

**DINKO:**

**The official process is too slow.**

By the time you get committee approval...

The opportunity is gone.

---

**NIKHIL:**

So stealth innovation becomes a survival strategy.

Not rebellion for its own sake.

But a practical way to protect fragile ideas...

Until they're strong enough to defend themselves.

**DINKO:**

The research found that stealth innovators typically:

Find hidden allies across the organization.

Access small discretionary resources — time, space, gear.

Develop a "cover story" for what they're working on.

Build a prototype to create proof before asking for permission.

**NIKHIL:**

That last one is key.

> Instead of asking "Can I try this?"...
> 
> You show "I tried this, and here's what happened."

**DINKO:**

That's a fundamentally different conversation.

## 💊 SEGMENT 2: THE PFIZERWORKS STORY

*[8 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Let me tell you the story of Jordan Cohen.

Senior Director of Organizational Effectiveness at Pfizer.

**NIKHIL:**

One of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.

Not exactly a startup culture.

**DINKO:**

In 2007, Cohen noticed something troubling.

Pfizer's highly skilled employees — 

Scientists. Researchers. People with PhDs —

Were spending **20 to 40 percent** of their time...

On what he called "scut work."

**NIKHIL:**

Data entry.

PowerPoint formatting.

Scheduling. Research compilation. Administrative tasks.

**DINKO:**

Work that didn't require their expertise.

Work that was eating into strategic thinking time.

**NIKHIL:**

So Cohen had an idea.

What if these tasks could be outsourced...

To external teams that specialize in them?

**DINKO:**

Now here's where most stories would say:

"He pitched it to leadership."

"Got buy-in."

"Launched a pilot program."

**NIKHIL:**

That's not what happened.

**DINKO:**

Cohen knew that if he pitched this idea officially...

It would get stuck in discussions.

People would raise objections.

HR would worry about job displacement.

IT would flag security concerns.

Finance would want ROI projections.

**NIKHIL:**

The idea would die before it could prove itself.

**DINKO:**

So he went stealth.

---

**NIKHIL:**

For over a year, Cohen operated under the radar.

**DINKO:**

He started small.

Found a few willing colleagues.

Connected them with external service providers.

Tracked what happened.

**NIKHIL:**

No formal budget allocation.

No executive sponsor.

No steering committee oversight.

**DINKO:**

Just... experimentation.

Proof gathering.

Quiet iteration.

**NIKHIL:**

And when he finally emerged with results?

**DINKO:**

The program had freed up an estimated **66,000 hours** of employee time.

By early 2009.

**NIKHIL:**

Shorter turnaround times.

More consistent quality.

Significant cost savings.

**DINKO:**

The program was called **PfizerWorks**.

And it became a widely studied case in innovation management.

---

**NIKHIL:**

Now here's the lesson:

If Cohen had asked permission first...

The idea might never have survived.

**DINKO:**

His bosses weren't hostile.

The organization wasn't dysfunctional.

It's just that new ideas are **fragile**.

And organizational immune systems are **strong**.

**NIKHIL:**

Stealth innovation isn't about being sneaky.

It's about protecting ideas...

Until they're strong enough to survive on their own.

## ✈️ SEGMENT 3: THE SKUNK WORKS FRAMEWORK

*[7 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Now let's go back in time.

1943.

World War II.

**NIKHIL:**

The US military needs a jet fighter — fast.

German jets are appearing over Europe.

And America is behind.

**DINKO:**

Lockheed gets the contract.

And an engineer named Kelly Johnson does something radical.

**NIKHIL:**

He takes a small team.

Moves them into a rented circus tent.

Near a smelly plastics factory.

**DINKO:**

And operates completely outside normal Lockheed procedures.

**NIKHIL:**

The result?

The P-80 Shooting Star.

Designed, built, and flight-ready...

In **143 days**.

*[Source: Lockheed Martin — [lockheedmartin.com](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/)]*

---

**DINKO:**

This became known as "Skunk Works."

And Kelly Johnson eventually codified what made it work...

Into **14 rules** for small-team innovation.

**NIKHIL:**

These rules have been studied by business schools...

And copied by companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon.

**DINKO:**

Let me share a few of the most relevant ones.

---

**NIKHIL:**

**Rule 1: The team must be small.**

Johnson said: "Keep people to an almost vicious minimum."

He recommended 10 to 25 percent of normal project staffing.

**DINKO:**

**Rule 2: Total autonomy for the project leader.**

The manager has complete control.

Reports only to a senior executive.

No layers of approval.

**NIKHIL:**

**Rule 3: Minimal paperwork.**

Reports should be brief and rare.

Work fast. Document later.

**DINKO:**

**Rule 4: Direct communication.**

No going through channels.

If you need to talk to someone — just talk to them.

*[Source: Kelly Johnson's 14 Rules — Multiple sources]*

---

**NIKHIL:**

Now, not every company can create a formal Skunk Works.

But the principles apply everywhere.

**DINKO:**

Small teams with clear mandates.

Autonomy to make decisions.

Protection from bureaucratic overhead.

**NIKHIL:**

And the key insight:

> Innovation happens faster...
> 
> When you reduce the number of people who can say "no."

---

---

## 🤫 SEGMENT 4: HERE'S WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU

*[4 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Now, here's the uncomfortable truth.

Stealth innovation exists because **official processes fail**.

**NIKHIL:**

Think about what it means when employees...

Feel the need to work "underground" to make something happen.

**DINKO:**

It means:

The formal idea pipeline is seen as bureaucratic.

Or slow.

Or politically captured.

**NIKHIL:**

It means employees believe:

"If I ask permission, I'll get a 'no.'"

Or worse: "If I ask permission, I'll get endless meetings."

**DINKO:**

That's a system failure.

Not an individual one.

---

**NIKHIL:**

Here's another nuance.

Stealth innovation has **risks**.

**DINKO:**

If your bootleg project fails...

You've spent organizational resources without approval.

That could be career-damaging.

**NIKHIL:**

If it succeeds but threatens the wrong people...

You could face backlash even from a win.

**DINKO:**

And there's an ethical dimension.

Are you using company time and resources...

For something the company didn't sanction?

**NIKHIL:**

The counter-argument:

If you're genuinely trying to benefit the organization...

And you reasonably believe the formal process would kill the idea...

Then stealth might be the only ethical choice.

**DINKO:**

That's the paradox we started with.

Sometimes doing the right thing for the organization...

Means bypassing the organization temporarily.

---

---

## 🔥 SEGMENT 5: DINKO VS. NIKHIL — THE DEBATE

*[6 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Alright, debate time.

Here's the question:

**Should organizations ENCOURAGE stealth innovation?**

**NIKHIL:**

I'll take the skeptical side.

If you encourage bootlegging...

Aren't you just admitting your official processes are broken?

Fix the processes instead.

**DINKO:**

Maybe you can't fix them.

Large organizations have bureaucracy for reasons.

Compliance. Risk management. Coordination.

You can't just remove that.

**NIKHIL:**

So you're saying the official system is necessary for governance...

But insufficient for radical innovation?

**DINKO:**

Exactly.

They serve different purposes.

**NIKHIL:**

Then how do you prevent stealth innovation from becoming chaos?

Everyone doing whatever they want?

**DINKO:**

You don't encourage ALL stealth innovation.

You create **bounded spaces** for it.

Like 20% time at Google.

Like innovation labs with different rules.

**NIKHIL:**

But Google actually killed 20% time eventually.

And many innovation labs produce nothing.

**DINKO:**

Fair criticisms.

But the principle stands:

Create zones where normal rules don't apply.

And accept that some great ideas will come from outside the system anyway.

---

**NIKHIL:**

Here's a question for listeners:

**Have you ever worked on something "under the radar"?**

Something you didn't officially have permission to do?

What happened?

**DINKO:**

And here's another:

**If you're a manager...**

Are there ideas your team isn't telling you about?

Why not?

---

---

## 🧰 SEGMENT 6: BUSINESS TOOLKIT

*[5 minutes]*

**NIKHIL:**

Okay, let's get practical.

Playbooks for two different audiences.

---

**DINKO:**

**If you're a manager who wants to enable stealth innovation:**

---

**NIKHIL:**

**Create "experimental blind spots" on purpose.**

Tell your team:

"I don't need a report unless you spend more than X hours or X dollars."

"Below that threshold — explore freely."

This gives people cover.

Without violating any rules.

**DINKO:**

**Offer discretionary resources.**

Every manager has small assets they control:

Unused lab time. An intern with slack capacity.

A small budget line for "maintenance."

Access to a customer willing to test things.

**NIKHIL:**

These micro-resources make experimentation possible.

Without requiring formal approval chains.

**DINKO:**

**Protect intent, not just outcomes.**

If a bootleg project hits trouble...

Don't abandon the person.

Say: "They were exploring options to improve our work."

**NIKHIL:**

You become the shield.

That's what good managers do.

---

**DINKO:**

**If you're someone working on a bootleg project yourself:**

---

**NIKHIL:**

**Build the smallest possible prototype first.**

Not a deck.

Not a document.

Something tangible.

A sketch. A mock-up. A demo.

**DINKO:**

People argue with ideas.

They don't argue with evidence.

**NIKHIL:**

**Find quiet allies.**

Don't try to convince the skeptics first.

Find the two or three people who "get it."

Recruit them before going public.

**DINKO:**

**Wait until you have proof.**

Come back when you've tested it with real users.

Or saved real time.

Or generated real results.

Then the conversation changes.

**NIKHIL:**

**Have an exit story ready.**

If you need to explain what you've been working on...

"I was exploring whether X could help us do Y."

That's not lying.

That's framing.

---

**DINKO:**

**Conversation starter for your team:**

> "What would you work on if you had a 'free pass' for a week?
> 
> Something you think would help us...
> 
> But that would be hard to get approved?"

**NIKHIL:**

That question will surface the ideas people are afraid to propose.

And some of them might be gold.

---

---

## 🎬 CLOSE

*[2 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

So here's the takeaway:

> Innovation isn't always legitimate.
> 
> Sometimes it needs to bypass the system...
> 
> In order to benefit the system.

**NIKHIL:**

Jordan Cohen at Pfizer didn't ask permission.

Kelly Johnson at Lockheed built jets in a tent.

And countless products you use every day...

Started as someone's "side project."

**DINKO:**

The best organizations don't fight this.

They create spaces for it.

They protect it.

They recognize that...

> The organizational immune system sometimes attacks its own future.

**NIKHIL:**

And your job — whether you're an employee or a manager —

Is to know when to work within the system...

And when to work around it.

**DINKO:**

Next week on Creativity Boosters —

We're back with more counterintuitive insights.

Subscribe wherever you listen.

Leave us a review.

**NIKHIL:**

And if you've got a bootleg project going on right now...

Good luck.

We're rooting for you.

**BOTH:**

Stay creative.
