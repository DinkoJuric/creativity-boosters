## 🎙️ INTRO + THESIS

*[2 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Welcome back to Creativity Boosters.

I'm Dinko...

**NIKHIL:**

...and I'm Nikhil.

**DINKO:**

Today we're talking about something that affects everyone in this economy —

Whether you hire consultants...

Work as a consultant...

Or compete with consultants.

**NIKHIL:**

Here's the thesis:

**The consulting industry is facing its first existential challenge.**

For decades, consulting firms made money on a simple arbitrage:

They knew things you didn't.

**DINKO:**

Research. Benchmarks. Frameworks. Best practices.

That was their moat.

**NIKHIL:**

But now?

ChatGPT knows those same frameworks.

AI can do that research faster.

And it costs **$20 a month**...

Not **$500,000 per engagement**.

**DINKO:**

So the question becomes:

**When knowledge becomes free...**

**What's left for consultants to sell?**

---

---

## 🚨 SEGMENT 1: THE 2025 REALITY CHECK

*[6 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Let's start with the scandal.

Because it tells you everything you need to know about where this is heading.

---

**NIKHIL:**

October 2025.

The Australian government commissioned Deloitte to produce an "independent assurance review"...

Of their welfare system.

**DINKO:**

237 pages.

A serious report.

The kind of thing you pay serious money for.

**NIKHIL:**

Except...

A University of Sydney academic named Christopher Rudge...

Decided to fact-check the citations.

**DINKO:**

First footnote?

Didn't exist.

**NIKHIL:**

Second footnote?

Made up entirely.

**DINKO:**

Third?

A quote attributed to a Federal Court judge...

That the judge never said.

**NIKHIL:**

The report was riddled with fabricated references.

Because Deloitte used **Azure OpenAI GPT-4o** to help generate it.

*[Source: Futurism, PC Mag — October 2025]*

---

**DINKO:**

The result?

Deloitte had to **refund AUD $440,000** to the Australian government.

That's roughly $291,000 US dollars.

**NIKHIL:**

But here's the thing —

This wasn't a one-off.

**DINKO:**

A month later, November 2025...

Deloitte Canada faced similar accusations.

A **$1.6 million healthcare report** for the Canadian government...

Same pattern.

Factual errors. False citations.

*[Source: Hindustan Times, November 2025]*

**NIKHIL:**

So let's be clear:

That's **two separate scandals**.

**Two different countries**.

**Two different reports**.

Same pattern: AI-generated content with fabricated sources.

**DINKO:**

And here's where it gets darkly funny:

There are now **betting sites taking odds**...

On whether Deloitte will have a **third AI scandal** before the end of 2025.

**NIKHIL:**

That's not a joke.

That's how badly this has damaged their credibility.

**DINKO:**

When bookmakers are making lines on your firm's next embarrassment...

You've got a brand problem.

---

**NIKHIL:**

Now zoom out.

This is happening across the consulting industry.

**DINKO:**

Global AI consulting spending hit **$3.75 billion in 2024**.

That's nearly **triple** the prior year.

**NIKHIL:**

But clients are complaining.

Quote:

> "Glossy reports rather than scalable solutions."

**DINKO:**

Some executives are ending contracts early.

They're saying, quote:

> "We'd rather develop AI capabilities in-house...
> 
> Than pay consultants to learn on our dime."

**NIKHIL:**

That's the backlash.

Consulting firms are selling AI expertise...

While misusing AI themselves.

The irony is painful.

---

---

## 📊 SEGMENT 2: THE NUMBERS

*[5 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Okay, let's look at how the Big Three are actually responding.

McKinsey. Bain. BCG.

**NIKHIL:**

Because here's the twist —

They're also **benefiting** from AI.

Even as AI disrupts their core model.

---

**DINKO:**

**McKinsey:**

40% of new projects now involve AI in some form.

They built an internal tool called **Lilli**.

70% of consultants are using it.

And it's cutting research time by **30%**.

**NIKHIL:**

**Bain:**

They did a deal with OpenAI in 2023.

Built a tool called **Sage**.

They say AI now represents **20-30%** of their business.

**DINKO:**

**BCG:**

90% of employees use AI.

50% use it daily.

They built something called **Deckster**...

Plus over **3,000 custom GPTs** for different use cases.

**NIKHIL:**

And get this —

BCG predicts AI will be **20% of their revenue in 2024**...

Growing to **40% by 2026**.

*[Source: BCG, McKinsey, Bain public reports — [consultancy.org](https://www.consultancy.org/)]*

---

**DINKO:**

So what's happening here?

These firms are doing two things at once.

**NIKHIL:**

**One:** They're using AI internally to work faster and cheaper.

**Two:** They're selling AI consulting services to clients.

**DINKO:**

But here's where it gets uncomfortable.

If AI makes consulting more efficient...

It also means clients need **fewer consultants**.

**NIKHIL:**

Or they can do the work themselves.

Which is exactly what some are starting to do.

---

---

## 🏛️ SEGMENT 3: THE THREAT MATRIX

*[7 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Alright, let's map what's actually threatened.

We call this the **value stack**.

**NIKHIL:**

Consulting firms have traditionally sold value at multiple levels.

Let's go through them.

---

**DINKO:**

**Level one: Data collection.**

Surveys. Interviews. Market research.

**AI impact?**

Heavily automated.

This is already happening.

**NIKHIL:**

**Level two: Analysis.**

Excel work. Pattern finding. Crunching numbers.

**AI impact?**

AI does this faster and cheaper than any junior consultant.

**DINKO:**

**Level three: Benchmarks.**

Proprietary databases.

"What are your competitors doing?"

**AI impact?**

Increasingly commoditized.

GPT-4 can synthesize public information almost as well.

**NIKHIL:**

**Level four: Frameworks.**

The 2x2 matrices.

Porter's Five Forces.

The strategic playbooks.

**AI impact?**

AI knows all the frameworks.

It can apply them in seconds.

---

**DINKO:**

Now we get to what's **not** easily automated.

**NIKHIL:**

**Level five: Judgment.**

"Given all this analysis... what should we actually do?"

**AI impact?**

AI can assist.

But humans still make the call.

**DINKO:**

**Level six: Relationships.**

Trust. Boardroom presence. Political navigation.

**AI impact?**

Still irreplaceable.

For now.

---

**NIKHIL:**

So here's the visual.

Think of the traditional consulting pyramid.

At the bottom, you have analysts — processing data.

Above them, associates — doing research and analysis.

Then managers, then partners.

**DINKO:**

That bottom of the pyramid...

Is being automated.

**NIKHIL:**

The pyramid is becoming an **obelisk**.

Fewer layers.

AI handles the grunt work.

Senior consultants plus AI equals smaller, faster teams.

---

**DINKO:**

There's an interesting study from BCG.

They found that AI boosted **creative problem-solving by 40%**.

**NIKHIL:**

But it made **business problem-solving 23% worse**.

**DINKO:**

Wait, what?

**NIKHIL:**

Because consultants were using AI for the wrong tasks.

They over-relied on it.

Stopped questioning outputs.

**DINKO:**

So the insight is:

AI augmentation requires **new skills**.

Not just adoption.

## 🤫 SEGMENT 4: HERE'S WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU

*[4 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Here's the irony nobody wants to admit.

Consulting firms are rushing to **sell** AI consulting services...

While AI is simultaneously **disrupting** their core business model.

**NIKHIL:**

Think about that.

> "We'll help you automate... your need for us?"

**DINKO:**

That's the absurd position they're in.

---

**NIKHIL:**

Now, what do clients actually pay for...

After AI handles the research and analysis?

**DINKO:**

**Conviction under uncertainty.**

AI hedges everything.

"It depends. Consider multiple factors."

Humans commit.

"Here's what we should do."

**NIKHIL:**

**Political cover.**

"McKinsey recommended it."

That line still has value.

Even if the analysis was AI-generated.

**DINKO:**

**Change management.**

Implementation isn't analysis.

You can't deploy an AI to run workshops...

And convince skeptical middle managers to change.

**NIKHIL:**

**Relationships.**

Boards want humans in the room.

For now.

---

**DINKO:**

So here's the key insight:

> The question isn't whether AI will replace consultants.
> 
> It's **which parts** of consulting it will replace.
> 
> And it turns out — the expensive parts.

---

---

## 🔥 SEGMENT 5: DINKO VS. NIKHIL — THE DEBATE

*[6 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Debate time.

Here's the question:

**Is "McKinsey said so" still worth paying for?**

**NIKHIL:**

I'll argue yes.

The analysis might be AI-generated.

But the brand carries legitimacy.

**DINKO:**

Does it though?

After the Deloitte scandal...

How much does "Big Four said so" really mean?

**NIKHIL:**

That's one scandal.

The brand survived decades of scandals.

Boards still trust the names.

**DINKO:**

But is that trust earned... or just habit?

**NIKHIL:**

Maybe both.

But change management still requires human presence.

You can't send a chatbot to convince a CFO.

**DINKO:**

Fair.

But here's the uncomfortable question:

If 80% of a consulting engagement is now AI-replaceable...

Shouldn't the price go down 80%?

**NIKHIL:**

*[laughs]*

That's the question clients are starting to ask.

---

**DINKO:**

Here's a provocative one for listeners:

**Would you hire a consultant who can't prompt engineer?**

Is AI fluency now table stakes for this profession?

**NIKHIL:**

And another:

**If you're a young consultant... should you stay or go?**

Is the analyst → partner path still viable...

If the analyst layer is being automated?

**DINKO:**

Some people are betting consulting splits into two industries:

AI-powered efficiency firms...

And human-judgment boutiques.

**NIKHIL:**

That's an interesting prediction.

We'll see.

---

---

## 🧰 SEGMENT 6: BUSINESS TOOLKIT

*[5 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Alright, let's bring this home.

**For companies thinking about hiring consultants:**

**NIKHIL:**

**Ask this question first:**

"What can't we do with AI ourselves?"

If the answer is "analysis" — you might not need consultants.

If the answer is "implementation and change management" — you might.

**DINKO:**

**New RFP questions to ask:**

What percentage of your team's time is AI-enhanced versus manual?

How do you verify AI outputs for our industry context?

What's your human value-add beyond what we could prompt ourselves?

**NIKHIL:**

**Consider a hybrid model:**

Hire consultants for 20% of the engagement — judgment and change management.

Use AI tools for 80% — research and analysis.

**Potential savings:** 60 to 70 percent.

---

**DINKO:**

**For consultants, current or aspiring:**

**NIKHIL:**

Skills that AI can't replace... yet:

Stakeholder navigation and politics.

Facilitation of difficult conversations.

Implementation and change management.

Building trust through presence.

**DINKO:**

Skills to develop immediately:

Prompt engineering and AI tool fluency.

Data validation and "AI bias detection."

Speed of synthesis — AI gives volume, you give clarity.

**NIKHIL:**

Career signal:

If your value is "I can do research faster"...

That's being automated.

If your value is "I help leaders decide under ambiguity"...

You're still safe.

---

**DINKO:**

**Conversation starter for your team:**

> "What's the last thing we paid a consultant to do...
> 
> That we could now accomplish with AI in-house?
> 
> And what would we STILL hire consultants for?"

**NIKHIL:**

**Metric to track:**

**Consulting Spend Efficiency Ratio.**

For your next engagement...

Measure what percentage of deliverables could have been AI-produced...

Versus what required human judgment.

**DINKO:**

Target:

Reduce "AI-replaceable" consulting spend by **50%** within 12 months.

---

---

## 🎬 CLOSE

*[2 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

So here's the takeaway:

> The consultant of 2030 looks nothing like the consultant of 2020.
> 
> The knowledge arbitrage that built MBB is dying.
> 
> What's left is judgment, relationships, and implementation.
> 
> The things AI can't fake.

**NIKHIL:**

The Deloitte scandal is a preview.

When AI replaces expertise without oversight...

Quality fails.

And so does trust.

**DINKO:**

Next week on Creativity Boosters —

**The Middle Manager's Dilemma.**

Are they bottlenecks... or bridges?

**NIKHIL:**

Research says: both.

And if you're a middle manager — or report to one —

This episode is for you.

**DINKO:**

Subscribe.

Leave a review.

And we'll see you next week.

**BOTH:**

Stay creative.
