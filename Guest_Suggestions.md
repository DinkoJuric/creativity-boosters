**Subject:** Creativity Boosters Podcast — If Spaghetti Organizations Are the Future

Dear Lars,

- You've recently been inducted into the Thinkers50 Hall of Fame — congratulations!

Our previous guests range from Heads of Entrepreneurship at the Danish Chamber of Commerce to Hollywood screenwriters who worked with Leonardo DiCaprio — so we curate thoughtfully.

Would you be open to a 30-40 minute conversation on **how organizations can innovate their own structure, not just their products?**

Warm regards,
Dinko & Nikhil
