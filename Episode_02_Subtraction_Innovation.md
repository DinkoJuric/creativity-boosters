## 📋 QUICK RECAP (For Host Preparation)

> **One-line summary:** The best innovations often come from removing features, not adding them — it's called subtraction innovation.

**Core Story:** PillPack removed everything patients hate about prescriptions (bottles, confusion, timing) and sold for $753M. This is a learnable methodology from SIT (Systematic Inventive Thinking).

**Red Thread / Narrative Arc:**
1. HOOK: Amazon paid $753M for a company that REMOVED things
2. EXAMPLES: PillPack, Nothing Phone, Wise, Toyota, Muji, Cirque du Soleil
3. FRAMEWORK: SIT 5-step subtraction process
4. NUANCE: When subtraction backfires (Google Wave, Instagram)
5. ACTION: Exercises to apply subtraction thinking Monday morning

**Positioning:** Practical methodology episode. Give them a repeatable framework, not just inspiration.

## 📑 THEMES & LEARNINGS (In Order)

- Humans default to addition (additive bias) — subtraction is counterintuitive
- PillPack: $753M exit by removing bottles, confusion, mental load
- SIT framework: 5-step subtraction process (list → select essential → imagine without → find dangling function → solve)
- iPod Shuffle: removed the screen, made shuffle the feature
- When it backfires: Google Wave, Instagram's algorithmic feed
- Rule: Subtraction without explanation = loss; subtraction WITH narrative = progress

> **📌 Note:** Nikhil may have additional examples, statistics, or stories that can enrich this discussion — check his notes before recording.

## 🎙️ INTRO + THESIS

*[2 minutes]*


**DINKO:**

Welcome back to Creativity Boosters.

I'm Dinko...

**NIKHIL:**

...and I'm Nikhil.

**DINKO:**

Last week we talked about first mover advantage.

Today we're flipping the script on innovation itself.

**NIKHIL:**

Because here's the thing —

When you ask people to innovate...

They almost always think about **adding** something.

More features. More options. More complexity.

**DINKO:**

But what if the best innovations come from **removal**?

This is called **subtraction innovation**.

And it's not just a philosophy.

It's a methodology.

**NIKHIL:**

Developed by the SIT Institute — Systematic Inventive Thinking.

The idea is simple but powerful:

Instead of asking "What can we add?"...

Ask "What can we take away?"

*[Source: Drew Boyd & Jacob Goldenberg, "Inside the Box" — [drewboyd.com](https://www.drewboyd.com/)]*

**DINKO:**

Today we're going to show you how this works...

With examples that might surprise you.

And a toolkit you can use **Monday morning.**

---

---

## 📖 SEGMENT 1: THE SHOWCASE

*[8 minutes]*

**NIKHIL:**

Alright, let's start with some examples.

Because this is easier to show than to explain.

---

**DINKO:**

**Example one: PillPack.**

Before PillPack, managing multiple prescriptions was a nightmare.

Multiple bottles. 

Different refill schedules.

"Did I take my morning pills?"

**NIKHIL:**

PillPack's insight was simple:

**Remove the bottles.**

**Remove the confusion.**

**Remove the mental load.**

Instead, they pre-sorted medications into daily packets.

Each labeled with the date and time.

**DINKO:**

They subtracted everything patients hated.

And in 2018, Amazon bought them for **$753 million**.

---

**NIKHIL:**

**Example two: Nothing Phone.**

When Nothing entered the smartphone market in 2022...

They didn't add more features.

They stripped the interface back.

**DINKO:**

Flashy UI? Removed.

Notification overload? Replaced with simple light patterns.

They called it the "Glyph Interface."

**NIKHIL:**

And it worked.

They developed a cult following...

By giving users **less**.

---

**DINKO:**

**Example three: Wise.**

Formerly TransferWise.

International money transfers used to go through a chain of banks.

Each taking a fee.

Each adding time.

**NIKHIL:**

Wise's innovation?

**Remove the intermediaries.**

Money doesn't actually cross borders in their system.

They match local payments.

**DINKO:**

The result?

Transfers that are **8 times cheaper** than traditional banks.

And much faster.

---

**NIKHIL:**

**Example four: Toyota Production System.**

This is the grandparent of subtraction innovation.

The entire TPS philosophy is built on one Japanese word:

**Muda.**

Which means... waste.

**DINKO:**

Toyota systematically subtracted every step that didn't add value.

Unnecessary movement. 

Excess inventory. 

Waiting time.

**NIKHIL:**

And this approach revolutionized manufacturing globally.

It's now known as "lean manufacturing."

*[Source: Toyota — [global.toyota](https://global.toyota/)]*

---

**DINKO:**

Now let's look at business models.

**NIKHIL:**

**Muji** removed branding itself.

No logos. 

No flashy packaging.

"No-brand" became the brand.

**DINKO:**

**Basecamp** removed most meetings.

They went async-first.

Employees reclaimed hours every week.

And they've been profitable since day one.

**NIKHIL:**

**Calendly** removed the back-and-forth of scheduling.

One link replaces ten emails.

**DINKO:**

**Southwest Airlines** removed assigned seating, first class, and hub-and-spoke routing.

And they became famous for the fastest turnarounds in the industry.

---

**NIKHIL:**

See the pattern?

These companies didn't add.

They subtracted.

And the market rewarded them.

---

---

## 🧠 SEGMENT 2: THE FRAMEWORK

*[8 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Okay, so how do you actually do this?

The SIT Institute developed a five-step process.

**NIKHIL:**

And here's the key —

It's not random.

It's systematic.

---

**DINKO:**

**Step one: List all components.**

Take whatever you're working on —

A product, a service, a process —

And list every part of it.

Don't skip anything.

---

**NIKHIL:**

**Step two: Select an "essential" component to subtract.**

Here's the trick.

Don't pick something trivial.

Pick something you think is **essential**.

Something everyone assumes you need.

---

**DINKO:**

**Step three: Imagine the product without it.**

This is what they call the "virtual product."

What would this thing look like...

Without that component?

---

**NIKHIL:**

**Step four: Identify the "dangling function."**

When you remove something, its function is now missing.

So you ask:

What job was that component doing?

---

**DINKO:**

**Step five: Solve.**

Now you have three options.

**Option A:** Another existing component takes over that function.

**Option B:** The user takes over. Like with Muji or IKEA.

**Option C:** You realize... it wasn't needed at all.

*[Source: SIT Methodology — [sitsite.com](https://www.sitsite.com/)]*

---

**NIKHIL:**

Let me give you a concrete example.

The **iPod Shuffle**.

Apple subtracted the screen and the graphical interface.

**DINKO:**

The "dangling function" was navigation.

How do you pick songs without a screen?

**NIKHIL:**

Their answer: shuffle mode.

Just hit play.

Let randomness be the feature.

**DINKO:**

And suddenly you had the cheapest, most gym-friendly iPod ever made.

All because they removed what everyone assumed was essential.

---

**NIKHIL:**

Now, why does this work?

There's a psychological concept called **cognitive fixedness**.

**DINKO:**

It's our brain's tendency to see things only in their current form.

We assume current components are essential...

Because they're there.

**NIKHIL:**

Subtraction forces us to break that assumption.

It makes us question what's really necessary.

And that's where innovation happens.

---

---

## 🤫 SEGMENT 3: HERE'S WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU

*[3 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Now, here's the nuance.

Subtraction isn't always easy.

And it can backfire.

**NIKHIL:**

**Google Wave.**

Remember that?

They subtracted email's structure.

Turned everything into real-time collaborative threads.

**DINKO:**

But nobody understood it.

It was too different.

They'd removed too much of what made email... email.

**NIKHIL:**

**Instagram's chronological feed.**

When they removed it in favor of algorithmic sorting...

Users revolted.

Petitions. Backlash. Years of complaints.

*[Sources: Various tech publications]*

---

**DINKO:**

So here's the hidden requirement:

**Subtraction needs explanation.**

You can't just remove things silently.

**NIKHIL:**

Wise explained **why** they cut out the banks.

Transparency. Speed. Savings.

**DINKO:**

Muji built an entire philosophy around "no brand."

They educated consumers on the value of simplicity.

**NIKHIL:**

Basecamp wrote a book about why fewer meetings means better work.

**DINKO:**

So the lesson is:

> "Subtraction without explanation feels like loss.
> 
> Subtraction WITH narrative feels like progress."

---

---

## 🔥 SEGMENT 4: DINKO VS. NIKHIL — THE DEBATE

*[5 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Alright, debate time.

Here's the question:

**Should you cut features that users asked for?**

**NIKHIL:**

I'll take the cautious side.

Users asked for it.

If you remove it, they'll complain.

They'll leave bad reviews.

Your competitors will add what you removed.

**DINKO:**

But here's the counter:

Users ask for features...

But they rarely use them.

There's data on this.

**80% of features get only 20% of usage.**

**NIKHIL:**

True.

But some of those unused features are "purchase triggers."

People buy because the feature exists —

Even if they never use it.

**DINKO:**

So you're arguing for feature theater?

**NIKHIL:**

*[laughs]*

I'm arguing for knowing which features actually drive purchase decisions...

Versus which ones just add maintenance cost.

**DINKO:**

Fair.

So the answer isn't "remove everything."

It's "know what matters."

**NIKHIL:**

Exactly.

Subtraction is surgical.

Not reckless.

---

**DINKO:**

Here's a provocative question for listeners:

**Is the feature you're most proud of... actually necessary?**

How would your product change if you removed your most complex feature?

**NIKHIL:**

And here's another:

**Why does "premium" mean "more features"?**

Should luxury products have **fewer** features... but better ones?

**DINKO:**

Think about it.

---

---

## 🧰 SEGMENT 5: BUSINESS TOOLKIT

*[7 minutes]*

**NIKHIL:**

Okay, let's give you some tools you can actually use.

**DINKO:**

**Exercise one: The Essential Component List.**

Take your product or service.

List every component.

Now **star** the ones you consider untouchable.

The ones everyone assumes are essential.

**NIKHIL:**

Here's the twist.

Now remove **only the starred ones**.

Thought experiment.

What happens?

You'll often find...

The "essential" items have hidden alternatives.

---

**DINKO:**

**Exercise two: The 80/20 Feature Audit.**

Look at your analytics.

Which 20% of features get 80% of usage?

**NIKHIL:**

Now calculate:

What's the maintenance cost of the other 80%?

The features nobody uses?

**DINKO:**

What would happen if you just... removed them?

**NIKHIL:**

Many products are 80% legacy bloat.

And nobody ever questions it.

---

**DINKO:**

**Exercise three: Subtraction Sprint.**

This is a team activity.

30 minutes.

Everyone brainstorms: "What if we removed X?"

**NIKHIL:**

Each person picks one "sacred" component.

Then pitches how the product would work without it.

**DINKO:**

This often surfaces hidden assumptions...

That nobody was questioning.

---

**NIKHIL:**

**Conversation starter for your next meeting:**

> "If we had to remove one feature from our product tomorrow — 
> 
> With no replacement — 
> 
> Which one would hurt users the least?
> 
> And why do we still have it?"

**DINKO:**

That question alone...

Will create a useful conversation.

---

**NIKHIL:**

**Metric to track:**

Your **Feature Usage Distribution.**

Run analytics.

What's actually used vs. what's just maintained?

**DINKO:**

Target:

Identify the 20% of features that get 80% of usage.

Then track the maintenance cost of the unused 80%.

**NIKHIL:**

Goal:

Reduce feature count by 10%...

Without reducing user satisfaction scores.

---

---

## 🎬 CLOSE

*[2 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

So here's the takeaway:

> The best innovations often come from asking...
> 
> "What can we remove?"
> 
> Instead of "What can we add?"

**NIKHIL:**

PillPack removed the bottles.

Wise removed the banks.

Toyota removed the waste.

And they all won.

**DINKO:**

**Here's your challenge for this week:**

Remove one thing.

From your product.

From your process.

From your meeting schedule.

See what happens.

**NIKHIL:**

You might be surprised.

**DINKO:**

Next week on Creativity Boosters —

**Is AI changing consulting as we know it?**

Spoiler: There's a $440,000 refund involved... 

And a 237-page report full of fake citations.

**NIKHIL:**

You're not going to want to miss it.

**DINKO:**

Subscribe.

Leave a review.

And we'll see you next week.

**BOTH:**

Stay creative.
