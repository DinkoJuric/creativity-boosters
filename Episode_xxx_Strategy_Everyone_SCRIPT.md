# Episode 6: Strategy Belongs to Everyone
## Script Guide — Segment by Segment

## 🎬 COLD OPEN (0:15)

> "Quick question: Who does strategy at your company? If your answer is 'the executives' — you might be leaving your best insights on the table. Research on top-performing companies reveals a counterintuitive secret: they make strategy everyone's job. Even the intern gets an hour a month to think strategically. Here's why that changes everything."

## 🎙️ INTRO + THESIS (2:00)

### Core Thesis
**Strategy fails at execution because the people who execute weren't involved in creation. When everyone contributes to strategy, alignment and adoption skyrocket.**

### Supporting Arguments
1. **Frontline intelligence is underused** — Employees see market realities executives miss
2. **Ownership follows involvement** — People support what they help create
3. **Low cost, high impact** — "One hour a month" is enough to shift mindset

### Why This Matters
- 70% of strategies fail at execution
- Change resistance often comes from "not my strategy"
- Best ideas often trapped at the bottom of the org chart

## 🧪 THE RESEARCH (7:00)

### What Top Companies Do Differently

| Traditional Approach | Top Company Approach |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Strategy = executive function | Strategy = everyone's job |
| Annual strategy offsite | Continuous strategic input |
| Frontline implements | Frontline contributes |
| Change announced top-down | Change co-created |

### The "One Hour a Month" Model
Some companies allocate protected time for ALL employees to:
- Reflect on one strategic question
- Submit observations and ideas
- Discuss in cross-functional groups

**Result:** Executives get hundreds of insights they'd never see otherwise.

### Why Execution Improves
- When people create strategy, they own outcomes
- When they own outcomes, resistance drops
- Ideas informed by frontline reality are more executable

## 💼 BUSINESS APPLICATION (6:00)

### The "Strategic Antenna" Concept
Every employee is exposed to signals executives miss:
- Customer complaints before they become trends
- Competitor moves observed in the field
- Operational bottlenecks that hide in dashboards

**Problem:** These insights rarely reach decision-makers
**Solution:** Create channels for strategic input at all levels

### How to Implement

| Level | Strategic Contribution |
|-------|----------------------|
| Frontline | "What are customers really saying?" |
| Middle Management | "What's blocking execution?" |
| Senior Leadership | "How do we synthesize these inputs?" |
| Executive | "How do we act on what we're hearing?" |

### Common Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Employees don't understand strategy" | They understand customers and operations — that IS strategy |
| "Too many cooks" | Aggregate insights; one synthesizer decides |
| "No time" | One hour a month is 0.6% of work hours |

## 🤫 HERE'S WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU (3:00)

### Strategy Cascades DOWN But Insights Flow UP
Most companies are good at cascading strategy downward.
Few are good at capturing insights that flow upward.

### The Real Barrier: Ego
- Executives may resist because "strategy is our job"
- Middle managers may filter to look smart
- Frontline may not believe their input matters

### Key Insight
> "If your strategy depends on people who weren't asked to contribute, you're hoping for buy-in you didn't earn."

## 🔥 DINKO VS. NIKHIL: THE DEBATE (5:00)

### Debate Topic
"Should the intern really be thinking about strategy?"

### Position A: Absolutely
- Fresh perspective is valuable
- Reduces groupthink
- Builds strategic muscle early

### Position B: Within Limits
- Some strategic info is confidential
- Input quality varies by experience
- Need clear process to avoid chaos

### Provocative Questions
1. "When's the last time a non-executive idea made it into your strategy?"
2. "How many good ideas died in the middle of your org chart?"
3. "If everyone got one hour a month for strategy, would you trust what surfaced?"

---

## 🧰 BUSINESS TOOLKIT (6:00)

### Exercise: The Strategy Hour
1. Choose ONE strategic question (e.g., "How might our market change in 3 years?")
2. Give ALL employees 1 hour of protected time to reflect
3. Collect inputs anonymously
4. Share patterns with leadership
5. Close the loop: show employees how their input was used

### Exercise: The Insight Audit
Ask yourself:
- What do frontline employees know that executives don't?
- What channel exists for that insight to reach strategy?
- When's the last time it was used?

### 💬 Conversation Starter
> "If you had one hour to advise the CEO on our strategy, what would you say?"

### 📈 Metric Shift
Track **strategic insight adoption rate** — what % of strategy inputs come from non-leadership? Target: 10% of actionable strategy items sourced from frontline within 6 months.

## 🎬 CLOSE (2:00)

### Single Takeaway
> "Strategy fails when it's a spectator sport. When everyone contributes, everyone executes."

### Next Episode Tease
*"Next week: Why less supervision often creates better work. We're exposing the trust-productivity paradox."*
