# Episode 3: AI & Consulting Disruption
## Script Guide — Segment by Segment

## 🎬 COLD OPEN (0:20)

> "October 2025. A 237-page government report lands on a professor's desk. He starts checking the citations. First footnote? Doesn't exist. Second? Made up. Third? A fake quote from a Federal Court judge. The report was written by Deloitte — one of the Big Four. They had to refund $440,000. The tool that wrote it? GPT-4. And this is just the beginning of consulting's reckoning with AI."

## 🎙️ INTRO + THESIS (2:00)

### Core Thesis
**The consulting industry is undergoing its first existential challenge. When broad AND deep knowledge becomes freely available, what's left for consultants to sell?**

### Supporting Arguments
1. **Knowledge arbitrage is dead** — ChatGPT knows the same frameworks as McKinsey
2. **The irony is painful** — Consulting firms selling AI expertise while being disrupted by AI
3. **The Deloitte scandal shows the risk** — When AI replaces expertise, quality control fails

### Why This Matters (Business Relevance)
- You're probably overpaying for work AI can now do in-house
- Your competitors are using AI to do 80% of "consulting work" internally
- Understanding this shift helps you negotiate smarter and build internal capabilities

### The Canadian Repeat (November 2025)
- **$1.6 million healthcare report** for Canadian government

### The Bigger Picture: "AI Backlash"
- Global AI consulting spending: **$3.75 billion in 2024** (3x prior year)
- Client feedback: "Glossy reports rather than scalable solutions"
- Some clients ending contracts to "develop AI capabilities in-house rather than pay consultants to learn on their dime"

## 📊 THE NUMBERS (5:00)

### Segment Goal
Show how MBB are responding — they're both adopting AND being disrupted by AI.

### Big Three AI Adoption (2024-2025)

| Firm | AI Stat | Internal Tool | Revenue Prediction |
|------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **McKinsey** | 40% of new projects involve AI | Lilli (70%+ adoption, 30% faster research) | Growing significantly |
| **Bain** | OpenAI partnership (2023) | Sage | AI = 20-30% of business |
| **BCG** | 90% employees use AI; 50% daily | Deckster + 3,000+ custom GPTs | 20% revenue (2024) → 40% (2026) |

📖 **Read more:** [BCG AI Report](https://www.bcg.com/) | [McKinsey on AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/) | [Bain AI Insights](https://www.bain.com/)

### The Efficiency Revolution
- **Software dev:** 15%+ reduction in engineering time
- **Customer service:** 20-35% faster manual responses
- **Research tasks:** ~30% faster (McKinsey's Lilli)
- **Report generation:** Dramatically automated (and sometimes dangerously so)

## 🏛️ THE THREAT MATRIX (7:00)

### Segment Goal
Map what's automated vs. what's protected — help listeners understand the value stack.

### The Traditional Pyramid Under Pressure

```
        Partners         ← Strategy, relationships (SAFE... for now)
           /\
          /  \
         /____\
        Managers         ← Project oversight (SHRINKING)
       /________\
      Associates         ← Research, analysis (MOST THREATENED)
     /_____________\
    Analysts             ← Data processing (BEING AUTOMATED)
```

### The Value Stack

| Layer | Traditional Role | AI Impact |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Data collection** | Surveys, interviews | ✅ Automated |
| **Analysis** | Excel, pattern finding | ✅ AI faster/cheaper |
| **Benchmarks** | Proprietary databases | ⚠️ Commoditizing |
| **Frameworks** | 2x2 matrices, strategies | ⚠️ AI knows them all |
| **Judgment** | "What should we do?" | ⚠️ AI assists, humans decide |
| **Relationships** | Trust, boardroom presence | ❌ Still human |

### BCG's Surprising Finding
- AI boosted **creative problem-solving by 40%**
- But made **business problem-solving 23% WORSE**
- **Insight:** Using AI for the wrong tasks makes consultants perform worse, not better

## 🤫 HERE'S WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU (4:00)

### The Irony
Consulting firms are rushing to **sell** AI consulting services while AI is **disrupting** their core business.

> "We'll help you automate... your need for us?"

### What Clients Really Pay For (After AI)
Once research and analysis are automated, what remains?

| Human Value | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Conviction under uncertainty** | AI hedges; humans commit |
| **Political cover** | "McKinsey recommended it" still has value |
| **Change management** | Implementation isn't analysis |
| **Relationships** | Boards want humans in the room |

### Key Insight
> "The question isn't whether AI will replace consultants — it's WHICH PARTS. And it turns out, the expensive parts."

---

## 🔥 DINKO VS. NIKHIL: THE DEBATE (6:00)

### Debate Topic
"Is 'McKinsey said so' still worth paying for?"

### Position A: Brand Still Matters
- Analysis may be AI-generated, but legitimacy comes from the firm
- Change management requires human presence
- Boards want a person to blame if things go wrong

### Position B: The Jig Is Up
- The Deloitte scandal proves quality control is failing
- Clients are ending contracts and building in-house
- The value gap is too visible now

### Provocative Questions
1. "Would you hire a consultant who can't prompt engineer?"
2. "If you're a young consultant, should you stay or go?"
3. "Will consulting split into two industries?" — AI efficiency firms vs. human-judgment boutiques

---

## 🧰 BUSINESS TOOLKIT (5:00)

### For Companies Hiring Consultants
1. **Ask: "What can't we do with AI ourselves?"**
   - If the answer is "analysis," you might not need consultants
   - If the answer is "implementation," you might

2. **New RFP Questions:**
   - What % of your time is AI-enhanced vs. manual?
   - How do you verify AI outputs for our industry?
   - What's your human value-add beyond what we could prompt ourselves?

3. **Hybrid Model:**
   - Hire consultants for 20% (judgment + change management)
   - Use AI for 80% (research + analysis)
   - **Potential savings:** 60-70%

### For Consultants
1. **Skills AI can't replace (yet):** Stakeholder politics, facilitation, change management
2. **Skills to build now:** Prompt engineering, AI bias detection, synthesis speed
3. **Career signal:** If your value is "research faster" — that's automated

### 💬 Conversation Starter
> "What's the last thing we paid a consultant to do that we could now accomplish with AI in-house? What would we STILL hire them for?"

### 📈 Metric Shift
Track **Consulting Spend Efficiency Ratio**:
- What % of deliverables could AI produce vs. required human judgment?
- Target: Reduce "AI-replaceable" consulting spend by 50% in 12 months

---

## 🎬 CLOSE (2:00)

### Single Takeaway
> "The consultant of 2030 looks nothing like the consultant of 2020. The knowledge arbitrage that built MBB is dying. What's left is judgment, relationships, and implementation — things AI can't fake."

### Next Episode Tease
*"Next week: Middle managers — are they bottlenecks or bridges? Research says they're both. We'll show you which one you are."*
