# EPISODE 4: THE MIDDLE MANAGER'S DILEMMA
## Full Episode Script — Formatted for Reading

**Episode Length:** ~35 minutes  
**Hosts:** Dinko Juric & Nikhil Unarkant

---

## 📋 QUICK RECAP (For Host Preparation)

> **One-line summary:** Middle managers are simultaneously blamed for killing innovation AND essential for making it happen — they're "informational valves" that determine whether ideas flow or die.

**Core Story:** Kordsa (Turkey) and Bayer both systematically turned middle managers into innovation enablers. Kordsa saw 3,239 frontline suggestions in one year with 85% implementation. Bayer trained 1,000+ innovation coaches.

**Red Thread / Narrative Arc:**
1. QUESTION: What happened to your best idea at work?
2. DUAL NARRATIVE: Research on middle managers as blockers AND enablers
3. SYSTEM: It's the incentives, not the people
4. EXAMPLES: Kordsa and Bayer — middle managers as innovation accelerators
5. ACTION: Track your pass-through rate; become a bridge

**Positioning:** The most personal episode — your audience IS the subject. Speaks directly to their experience.

---

## 📑 THEMES & LEARNINGS (In Order)

- The "frozen middle" myth vs. "bridge builders" reality — both are true
- Research: strong middle management engagement → significantly better innovation outcomes
- It's the incentives, not the people: short-term rewards → risk aversion → bottleneck behavior
- "Informational valves": middle managers control what flows up and what flows down
- Kordsa: 3,239 suggestions, 85% implemented — middle managers as first filter
- Bayer: 1,000+ innovation coaches, 5,000+ employees trained
- Institutional memory isn't always resistance — sometimes it's wisdom
- Metric: Innovation pass-through rate (ideas generated → escalated → implemented)

## 🎙️ INTRO + THESIS

*[2 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Welcome back to Creativity Boosters.

I'm Dinko...

**NIKHIL:**

...and I'm Nikhil.

**DINKO:**

Today's topic is personal.

Because our audience IS today's subject.

**NIKHIL:**

Young professionals.

Middle managers.

The people stuck between strategy and execution.

**DINKO:**

Here's our thesis:

**Middle managers are simultaneously blamed for killing innovation...**

**AND essential for making it happen.**

**NIKHIL:**

They're called the "frozen middle."

The bottlenecks.

The gatekeepers who kill good ideas.

**DINKO:**

But research shows something more nuanced.

They're actually **informational valves**.

They control what flows up and what flows down.

**NIKHIL:**

The question isn't whether to have middle managers.

It's how to transform bottlenecks into bridges.

## 📊 SEGMENT 1: THE RESEARCH

*[7 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Let's start with the research.

Because there are two competing narratives here.

---

**NIKHIL:**

**Narrative one: The case AGAINST middle managers.**

This is the "frozen middle" story.

**DINKO:**

**Gatekeeping.**

Middle managers filter innovations before senior leaders ever see them.

Good ideas die in someone's inbox.

**NIKHIL:**

**Risk aversion.**

They prioritize short-term results over long-term bets.

Because that's what their performance reviews reward.

**DINKO:**

**Fear of failure.**

Championing an unproven project is a career risk.

If it fails — that's on you.

**NIKHIL:**

**Status quo bias.**

They're perceived as change-resistant.

Because they've seen initiatives come and go.

They've got institutional memory...

Which can look like cynicism.

*[Source: Viima — [viima.com](https://www.viima.com/)]*

---

**DINKO:**

Now here's **narrative two: The case FOR middle managers.**

This is the "bridge builders" story.

**NIKHIL:**

**Translation.**

Middle managers take abstract strategy...

And convert it into actionable team initiatives.

Without them, strategy is just a PowerPoint.

**DINKO:**

**Resource allocation.**

They direct departmental resources toward innovation.

They decide what actually gets time and budget.

**NIKHIL:**

**Uncertainty management.**

During change, employees look to their direct manager for cues.

Middle managers who reduce anxiety...

Create smoother transitions.

**DINKO:**

**Internal change agents.**

Research from Cambridge shows middle managers bring novel knowledge...

Through proactive participation in innovation processes.

*[Source: Cambridge University Press — [cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/)]*

**NIKHIL:**

**Implementation leadership.**

They're planners, coordinators, motivators, evaluators.

The messy work of actually making change happen.

---

**DINKO:**

So which narrative is true?

**NIKHIL:**

Both.

And that's the dilemma.

**DINKO:**

The critical finding from research:

Organizations with **strong middle management engagement** in innovation...

Are **significantly more likely** to report successful outcomes.

But organizations where middle managers are disengaged or blocked...

See innovation initiatives fail.

## ⚙️ SEGMENT 2: THE INCENTIVE PROBLEM

*[6 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Okay, so if middle managers can be either bottlenecks OR bridges...

What determines which one they become?

**NIKHIL:**

Here's the uncomfortable answer:

**The system.**

---

**DINKO:**

Look at what gets rewarded in most organizations:

Short-term results.

Proven strategies.

Low-risk decisions.

"No surprises."

**NIKHIL:**

Now look at what innovation requires:

Long-term bets.

Unproven experiments.

High-risk ideas.

Learning from failure.

**DINKO:**

See the mismatch?

**NIKHIL:**

When you're measured on quarterly performance...

Blocking a risky idea is the **safe** choice.

Championing a failed project is **career damage**.

Delegating innovation to someone else means **minimal exposure**.

**DINKO:**

So here's the insight:

> Middle managers aren't broken.
> 
> They're responding rationally to broken incentives.

---

**NIKHIL:**

There's a concept in the research called the **"informational valve."**

Middle managers control two flows:

**DINKO:**

**Upward flow:**

Which frontline ideas reach senior leadership?

Middle managers decide.

**NIKHIL:**

**Downward flow:**

How is strategy translated to teams?

Middle managers interpret.

**DINKO:**

**The risk:**

When valves close, innovation dies in silence.

Nobody even knows the idea existed.

**NIKHIL:**

**The opportunity:**

When valves open intelligently...

They filter noise AND amplify signal.

**DINKO:**

Good middle managers don't pass everything up.

They curate.

They add context.

They champion the ideas worth fighting for.

## 🏭 SEGMENT 2.5: THE BRIDGE BUILDERS IN ACTION

*[4 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Let me show you what it looks like when middle managers get it right.

Not theory — real examples.

**NIKHIL:**

These are companies that have systematically turned their middle managers...

Into innovation engines.

---

**DINKO:**

**Example one: Kordsa.**

This is a Turkish materials and composites company.

Not exactly the industry you'd expect to be leading in innovation.

**NIKHIL:**

But here's what they did:

They gave middle managers a specific mandate:

> Create time and space for frontline employees to innovate.

**DINKO:**

These managers became the first filter in a stage-gate process.

They review ideas from frontline workers.

They select the promising ones.

They provide cover for experimentation.

**NIKHIL:**

In 2020 alone...

Frontline employees in Turkey submitted **3,239 improvement suggestions**.

**85% were put into practice.**

*[Source: Kordsa Sustainability Report, INSEAD case study — [insead.edu](https://www.insead.edu/)]*

**DINKO:**

That's not top-down innovation.

That's middle managers actively **championing ideas from below**.

---

**NIKHIL:**

**Example two: Bayer.**

Pharmaceutical giant.

Over 100,000 employees.

**DINKO:**

Bayer recognized that innovation was getting stuck in the hierarchy.

So they did something radical:

They trained over **1,000 innovation coaches**.

And engaged over **5,000 employees** in innovation training.

*[Source: Bayer corporate reports, IMD Business School — [imd.org](https://www.imd.org/)]*

**NIKHIL:**

The coaches weren't senior executives.

They were middle managers.

Line managers.

**DINKO:**

Their job: create psychological safety.

Make it okay to propose ideas.

Make it okay to fail fast.

**NIKHIL:**

And it worked.

Bayer's innovation pipeline accelerated significantly.

Because the people in the middle...

Stopped being gates.

And became **accelerators**.

---

**DINKO:**

So here's the question this raises:

**What would happen if every middle manager in your organization...**

Saw their job as "innovation enabler"?

Not just "task coordinator"?

**NIKHIL:**

The difference isn't about hiring different people.

It's about giving the same people...

A different mandate.

---

---

## 🤫 SEGMENT 3: HERE'S WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU

*[4 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Now let's challenge the "frozen middle" myth.

Because I think it's unfair.

**NIKHIL:**

Here's the thing:

Middle managers often have **limited decision-making power**.

They must work within parameters set by senior leaders.

**DINKO:**

Their resistance might actually be **institutional memory**.

"We tried this in 2019. It failed for these reasons."

That's not cynicism.

That's wisdom.

**NIKHIL:**

But from above, it looks like obstruction.

---

**DINKO:**

There's interesting research on participation style.

**NIKHIL:**

When middle managers are treated as **creators and designers** of change...

They have lower personal uncertainty.

And they produce better outcomes.

**DINKO:**

When they're treated as **implementers only**...

Higher anxiety.

More resistance.

**NIKHIL:**

So the implication is clear:

**Involve middle managers in strategy — not just execution.**

When they co-create, they're invested.

When they're handed a plan and told to execute...

They find reasons why it won't work.

*[Source: University of Queensland research]*

---

**DINKO:**

So here's the key insight:

> The frozen middle isn't a people problem.
> 
> It's a system problem.
> 
> Fix the system...
> 
> And the people will innovate.

---

## 🔥 SEGMENT 4: DINKO VS. NIKHIL — THE DEBATE

*[7 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Debate time.

Here's the question:

**Should middle managers have veto power over innovations?**

**NIKHIL:**

I'll argue yes.

Because sometimes...

Bad ideas need to be killed.

**DINKO:**

But who decides what's a bad idea?

The person with the most to lose from change?

**NIKHIL:**

Middle managers have context senior leaders lack.

They know what's actually executable.

They know what resources exist.

They know the team.

**DINKO:**

True.

But the ratio concerns me.

How many ideas get filtered versus forwarded?

I'd guess it's heavily weighted toward filtering.

**NIKHIL:**

Maybe that's appropriate.

Not every idea deserves resources.

**DINKO:**

Or maybe good ideas die because someone's incentive is to avoid risk.

**NIKHIL:**

So we're back to incentives.

**DINKO:**

Exactly.

---

**DINKO:**

Here's a provocative question:

**Is flattening the org chart the answer?**

Companies like Valve and Morning Star removed middle managers entirely.

Did innovation increase?

**NIKHIL:**

Interesting cases.

Valve is legendarily creative.

But also legendarily chaotic.

**DINKO:**

So maybe the answer isn't removing middle managers...

But changing what they're rewarded for.

**NIKHIL:**

Agreed.

---

**DINKO:**

Another one:

**Is "institutional memory" an excuse or an asset?**

When's "we tried this before" wisdom...

Versus resistance?

**NIKHIL:**

Depends on whether they explain WHY it failed...

And whether circumstances have changed.

**DINKO:**

Good distinction.

---

**NIKHIL:**

Here's one for our listeners:

**Are you a valve or a bridge?**

Honest self-assessment.

Do you filter too much?

Do you facilitate too little?

**DINKO:**

And if you report to a middle manager:

Are they a valve or a bridge?

And can you route around them if needed?

---

---

## 🧰 SEGMENT 5: BUSINESS TOOLKIT

*[7 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

Okay, let's get practical.

We've got playbooks for three different roles.

---

**NIKHIL:**

**If you're a middle manager yourself:**

---

**DINKO:**

**Rule one: The "One Up, One Down" Rule.**

For every idea you filter OUT...

Advocate for at least one idea UP.

Track your ratio.

Are you mostly blocking... or mostly enabling?

**NIKHIL:**

**Exercise: The Pre-Mortem Test.**

Before killing an idea, ask yourself these questions:

What would have to be true for this to work?

Is my objection about feasibility... or about my own comfort?

Who else should weigh in before I decide?

What's the smallest version we could test?

**DINKO:**

**Build "Innovation Credit."**

Advocate loudly for one risky project that succeeds.

When it works — you've earned permission to champion future ideas.

Middle managers with innovation wins get more latitude.

**NIKHIL:**

**Own the translation role.**

When strategy comes down from above...

Don't just relay instructions.

Interpret meaning.

Help your team see how their work connects to the bigger picture.

Your value is context — not pass-through.

---

**DINKO:**

**If you're a senior leader trying to enable middle managers:**

---

**NIKHIL:**

**Change the incentives.**

Add innovation metrics to performance reviews.

Reward championing good bets — even if they fail.

Celebrate "glorious failures" publicly.

**DINKO:**

**Involve them in strategy.**

Let middle managers participate in planning.

They have frontline intelligence you lack.

When they co-create, they're invested.

**NIKHIL:**

**Create "safe to fail" zones.**

Give middle managers small innovation budgets they control directly.

Remove approval chains for experiments under a certain dollar amount.

Make experimentation easy — not bureaucratic.

---

**DINKO:**

**If you're a frontline employee trying to work WITH middle managers:**

---

**NIKHIL:**

**Understand their position.**

They face pressure from above AND below.

Help them make the case to senior leaders.

Give them data, not just ideas.

**DINKO:**

**Make your ideas "low risk" to champion.**

Propose the smallest viable test.

Make experiments reversible.

Offer to own the work yourself.

**NIKHIL:**

**Find the innovation allies.**

Not all middle managers are bottlenecks.

Look for who's championed ideas before.

Route your ideas through the facilitators.

---

**DINKO:**

**Conversation starter for your next one-on-one:**

> "Think about the last five ideas that came from your team.
> 
> How many made it to senior leadership?
> 
> How many did you filter out?
> 
> And were you right to do so?"

**NIKHIL:**

**Metric to track:**

**Innovation Pass-Through Rate.**

Count how many ideas your team generates...

Versus how many you escalate...

Versus how many get implemented.

Calculate your pass-through rate at each stage.

**DINKO:**

Target:

Increase idea escalation by 25%...

While maintaining quality.

Measured by the implementation rate of escalated ideas.

---

---

## 🎬 CLOSE

*[2 minutes]*

**DINKO:**

So here's the takeaway:

> You're either a bottleneck or a bridge.
> 
> The system may push you toward bottleneck.
> 
> But the choice is still yours.

**NIKHIL:**

If you're a middle manager...

Track your batting average this week.

How many ideas filtered?

How many forwarded?

**DINKO:**

And if you report to one...

Understand what they're up against.

Help them look good.

Give them data.

**NIKHIL:**

This was our most personal episode...

Because our audience IS the subject.

**DINKO:**

Next season on Creativity Boosters —

More counterintuitive insights.

More frameworks you can use Monday morning.

And more debates that make you think.

**NIKHIL:**

Make sure you're subscribed.

Leave us a review.

And share this episode with a middle manager who needs to hear it.

**DINKO:**

Or with someone who reports to one.

**BOTH:**

Stay creative.
